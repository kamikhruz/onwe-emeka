    Lavender falls is an a tourist center in the the great city of dragonspawnia. it dates back to 100A.O 
    and the mysterious thing about it is that nobody know how it was created- probably lost in time.
    Allele traffic is usually heavy around this area for obvious reasons. Although it is not the only tourist
    center in dragonspawnia, it is the most popular afterall- for obvious reasons too.</font>
